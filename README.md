# This is a simple catalog that uses the [Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) and the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

It allows you to:
- query films and set favourites
- query persons, locations, vehicles and species
- last query and favourite movies are persistant

What is missing:
- Cannot unset favourites
- Fix a bug that allows adding same films as favourite multiple times

You can see it live [here](https://ghibli-api-catalog.herokuapp.com)
